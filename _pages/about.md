 Hi! I am a Ph.D candidate in the [Systems Biology Group](http://www.sb.cs.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, advised by [Prof. Ziv Bar-Joseph](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zivbj){:target="_blank"}.
 My current research focuses on developing machine learning methods for the analysis of spatial proteomics datasets, as part of the [Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://hubmapconsortium.org/){:target="_blank"}. I also work with collaborators at [Enable Medicine](https://www.enablemedicine.com/){:target="_blank"} and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).

##### Research Interests:
- machine learning for genomics and proteomics
- spatial statistics
- deep learning
- computer vision
- survival analysis and prediction
- unsupervised/self-supervised learning

##### Previously: [[CV](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf)]  
I earned my BA and MEng degrees in Engineering, with specializations in Information Engineering and Bioengineering, from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. There, I worked with [Dr. Timothy O'Leary](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/tso24){:target="_blank"} and collaborated with [Prof. Jim Haseloff](https://haseloff.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} on deep learning approaches for the segmentation of plant microscopy images.

##### Misc.
During my free time, I enjoy climbing (find me at [Iron City Boulders](https://ironcityboulders.com/){:target="_blank"}!), cooking/baking, biking, golfing, and playing volleyball. I own a small van named Mochi, and am (slowly) working on converting it to a campervan! One day I may make some blog posts about the process.
