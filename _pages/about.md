Hi! I'm a computational biologist at [Biohub](https://biohub.org/) and a member of the DeRisi Lab at UCSF. My current research is focused on developing and applying machine learning models to better understand autoimmune disease, specifically studying antibody-antigen interactions at scale. 

##### Research Interests:
- machine learning for biology
- modeling antibody-antigen interactions
- biology foundation models for patient-focused research
- computer vision

##### Previously: 
I did my PhD in the [Systems Biology Group](http://www.sb.cs.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, advised by [Prof. Ziv Bar-Joseph](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zivbj){:target="_blank"}.
My thesis focused on developing machine learning methods for the analysis of spatial proteomics datasets, as part of the [Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://hubmapconsortium.org/){:target="_blank"}. I collaborated closely with [Enable Medicine](https://www.enablemedicine.com/){:target="_blank"} and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).

I earned my BA and MEng degrees in Engineering, with specializations in Information Engineering and Bioengineering, from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. There, I worked with [Dr. Timothy O'Leary](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/tso24){:target="_blank"} and collaborated with [Prof. Jim Haseloff](https://haseloff.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} on deep learning approaches for the segmentation of plant microscopy images.

##### Misc.
During my free time, I enjoy climbing, mountaineering, cooking/baking, cycling, golfing, and playing volleyball. My fiancé and I own a small camper van named Mochi, which we use for many of our outdoor adventures.
